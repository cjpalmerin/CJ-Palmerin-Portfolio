# Homework-7-Portfolio

Utilizing html, bootstrap, and css, I have created a basic layout for an updated portfolio. Utilizing a minimalist, dark layout, I left room for any future ideas that I can implement as we move further into learning new skills in the bootcamp program. 

Included is an about me, links to all required websites, an updated resume, as well as project one and two homework assignments.
